# About-Me 🤓

Hello my name is Wyatt Anderson, I am a freshman at Virginia Commonwealth University studying Information Systems with a minor in Practical Artifical Inteligence at their Snead School of Business.

I am interested in Artifical Inteligence, Machine Learning, Information Technology, and integrating new technologies into the world of business to keep the world updated with the latest technologies.

I love to create things that will make my life easier and cool tools I can share with the world, so check out some of my projects!
